# First-Pygame--PokeTrumps *still in development*
## My first Pygame based on the Poketrumps text game! :video_game:

This project uses Pygame to create a more graphical version of the PokeTrumps text game made for my CFG Python kickstarter.

Unfortunatley I was using my dodgy laptop without online version control so lost quite a bit of progress :see_no_evil: 
I will come back to it to re-code after a little break (this time with regular commits!)
